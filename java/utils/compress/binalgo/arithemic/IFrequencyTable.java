Reference arithmetic coding

This project is a clear implementation of arithmetic coding, suitable as a reference for educational purposes. It is provided separately in Java, Python, C++, and is open source.

The code can be used for study, and as a solid basis for modification and extension. Consequently, the codebase optimizes for readability and avoids fancy logic, and does not target the best speed/memory/performance.
