# CaesarCipher

**A simple Java caesar cipher program**

The Caesar Cipher is named after Julius Caesar, a roman general and consul. It's one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. The idea behind the Caesar Cipher is to replace a letter with a different one a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. In this example code I use a shift of three letters up the alphabet. For example, A would be replaced by D.
