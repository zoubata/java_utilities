# Welcome to the server


# Project

This project offer services to account provided by nodes

## account
Any guy that have a wallet have a account from its public key.
it paid wit the wallet the fee at 100%

## services

### http pages
Some page for the architecture is generated automaticaly, 
Each account can have a sub site.
The page can be written in [MarkDown](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to simplify the Write.
The sub site can be requested from any node, the web Browser will be redirected to the good server.
### file sharing
The access can be done from ftp, http.


### ftp file transfert
TBD
### irc chat
TBD
### Etherum Name Service
offers the possibility too identify the accoutn from ENS
ToBe develop
### linux account on a remote VM
To be Clarify

## Nodes
The nodes store, and run the software of project to support the services
The node received fee for that about 33% according to storage size, bandwith cpu/ram performance and activity.


## Account
paid for the service 100%

# Architecture
The network of node is decentralized, as a peer to peer network, any node can duplicate the service,files
By connecting to any node you get the service.
The data/service are duplicated on few nodes, offering a continuous service.

## authentication
id is the public key of the wallet of the account
connection is like to a signature mechanism.


## developers
The developers received money 33% for the new feature provided

# Economics model
The nodes come for the fee, they can turnoff the night if supply by sun, there is despondency across the network.
The users find price every aggressive.
Developers work to improve the experience of users

some fee are keep for significant evolution.
use the practice of crypto world to find node ressources, offers service to a large public.
a coin can be created, but in short tern, we will reuse an existing one, almost stable with low fees.
